# Real-Time-Traffic-Congestion-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Urban-Traffic-Data
Developed a real-time machine learning model to predict traffic 
congestion using urban traffic data. Analyzed and preprocessed 
large datasets, implemented predictive algorithms, and applied 
normalization techniques. The project aims to assist city planners 
and commuters in optimizing travel routes and reducing traffic 
congestion.
